									<h2>                                  BY Aron Michael Delson</h2>
									
									<header>
										<h2>Introduction</h2>
										<p>In the realm of robotics, innovation often takes inspiration from nature's most ingenious designs. One such marvel is the full legged spider robot. Humans cannot travel to every point on the surface, yet they still require information from such locations. As a result, researchers carefully analysed and have designed a cutting-edge technology a biomimetic robot. This portfolio documents my experience in designing and developing a prototype for a four-legged spider. Throughout this module, I have explored various techniques and technologies to create a virtual prototype, which was then translated into a physical prototype.</p>

					
										<h2>Product Development Strategy: A Chronological Narrative</h2>
											
										<h2>Phase 1: Conceptualization (Weeks 1-4)</h2>
										<p>In the initial phase, our team brainstormed ideas for a conversational AI bot that could be of use the society, something that is also compatible with the university guidelines but at the same time should also look cool enough. We conducted research, put out different idea out there and identified key features that our bot should possess. We then decided to focus on building a four legged spider bot.</p>

										<h2> Successes: </h2>
										<ul>
												<li>	Identified key features and functionalities for the bot </li>
												<li>	Established a clear direction for the project </li>
										</ul>			



							<h2> Challenges: </h2>
										<ul>
												<li>	•	Difficulty in defining the scope of the project</li>
												<li>	•	Limited understanding of the technical requirements </li>
										</ul>	

							<h2>Purpose </h2>
										<p> A biomimetic robot can explore earth's environment in dangerous and difficult places. By carefully studying the anatomy of  a spider, researchers aim was to replicate or mimic the moments of a spider that gives the same range of motion similar to spiders natural movement. This inspired the 3° of freedom fabrication for each leg which minimises the robots weight and complexity. The chosen structure gives the robot manoeuvrability on uneven surface including examining precarious structures like earthquakes, tsunami's or volcanic eruptions. </p>

							
							

								
									<h2>Phase 2: Virtual Prototyping and Stimulation (Weeks 5-8)</h2>
									<p> Initially I had to create the virtual robotic exoskeletons. Virtual prototyping is crucial in spider bot making as it enables early software development, reducing the total time necessary to develop and test new products.  This makes it cost effective and allows me to carry out a hypothesis-driven virtual experiments on my robot. In this report, we will also talk about the significance of virtual prototyping, the tools used, the challenges faced and the transitioning to physical prototyping. With a clear understanding of the project's scope, the next step was designing the spider bot. </p>

											<h3>Computer-Aided Design (CAD)</h3>
											<p>CAD software such as SolidWorks, Autodesk Inventor allows engineers to create detailed 3D models of spider bot and optimize the performance of the robots before they are built. Using such software allows the user to simulate the movement of the bot based on the roles depicted by the bot. </p>
											
											
											<ul>
												<li>	<b>Autonomous Vehicles and Drones</b>:AGVs and drones are other examples where CAD plays an important role. These are boats that are used in sectors where the object is always moving. CAD helps the engineer to work on the frame of the vehicle or drone virtually to test ground movements and how will it function in air. It also provides the user with different simulations such as terrains and other obstacles in which the user can navigate the vehicle and make sure they are more effective in real world applications.</li>
												<li>	<b>	Humanoid Robots</b> 
                                                                                           Robots that resemble humans, like Honda's ASIMA, are examples of the most cutting-edge robotics applications. These are robots whose joints and exoskeletons are modelled using advanced computer-aided design (CAD) technologies. Next, in order to evaluate the robot's agility, the developers build simulated surroundings where it may walk, run, and climb. </li>												
											<h3>3D Modelling Software</h3>
												<p>
												3D modelling software plays a vital role in the design and development process, enabling designers and engineers to create a digital prototype of the robot, test its functionality, and refine its design before physical prototyping. The software allows me to customise and personalise 3D models down to the smallest detail ensuring the object matches the design accurately. It enables the creation of complex geometries that may be difficult or impossible to achieve using traditional manufacturing methods. It also allowed me to make quick changes before printing the final version.
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>	<b>•	Aerospace Engineering</b>In the aerospace industry 3D morning software plays a vital role in the development of complex digital models off spacecraft, aircraft and missiles. Does enables engineers to optimise the design of their craft by reducing weight and improving performance when stimulating the behaviour of these vehicles under heavy turbulence and extreme temperatures. They are able to refine the design before producing a physical prototype. </li>
												<li>	<b>•	Medical Device Development</b> In the medical device industry, 3D modelling software plays a critical role in the design and development of medical implants, surgical instruments, and diagnostic equipment. The software enables designers to create complex digital models of these devices, test their performance, and refine their design before physical prototyping. 3D modelling software enables designers to optimize the design of medical devices, reducing material costs and improving performance of these devices under various conditions, such as stress and fatigue.</li>
											</ul>
											<h3>Motion Capture Hardware</h3>
																							<p>Motion capture is the process of capturing moments of a sculpture or artist, this moment can then be translated into digital form for precise digital sculpting. This digital model can then be printed into a 3D model to create a physical representation of the original sculpture. This could play a vital role in the development of my spider bot by enabling the precise recording of movement patterns, which can then be replicated or analysed to enhance the bot’s locomotion. I was unable to duplicate anything because I lacked a pre-made model of a spider bot, thus I refrained from using it during the design development process. Other industries benefit from motion capture are:</p>


											<ul>
												<li>	<b>3D 	Sports and Fitness</b> Motion capture technology is utilised in the sports and fitness industries to enhance athletic performance. It accomplishes this by giving the user tiny reflective markers to place on common athlete vital locations, such as the knees, shoulders, hips, and joints. These are important starting points for a significant shift that must be documented. The athlete is then captured on camera by a motion capture device while they execute a sequence of actions like running, jumping, and throwing. Their instructors or trainers then examine the captured data to gain important insights about their motions and shortcomings.</li>
												<li>	<b>3D Video Games and Animation</b> Motion capture technology is used in the video game and animation industries to record people's movements, allowing animators to generate realistic character movements. Wearing a capture suit or a suit with reflective marker points that pre-mark the essential joint movements, an actor executes a series of actions. A motion capture technology is then used to record the actors' motions and gather real-time data. After being converted into a digital format, the captured data is applied to a 3D character model. This 3D character model shows the actor's actions as they would appear in an animated film or video game. </li>
											</ul>
												<h3>3D Scanning Hardware, Software, and Workshop Facilities</h3>
												<p>it's a high precision 3D scanner or laser scanner which captures physical objects and convert them into digital models.  The hardware typically involves laser or structured light scanners, which create detailed 3D models by capturing millions of data points from the surface of an object. High-resolution 3D scanners like the Artec Eva or the Faro Arm can capture fine details of prototype parts, ensuring accuracy in the digital twin. I didn’t use this software in the building of my spider bot as it was not required. But various other industries that use 3d scanning are</p>

												
											<ul>
												<li>	<b>•	3D scanning in healthcare</b> The hospital uses a 3D scanner to scan the patient's body's physical components, including the size and form of their bones and organs. A software is used to process the discount data and produce a three-dimensional model of the scanned area. They can provide treatments by testing it on a 3d model. Also by offering precise scans of the bodily part that has been amputated and attaching the 3D model to it, they are also utilised in the creation of prosthesis or implants.</li>
												<li>	<b>•	3D Scanning in Film and Video Production</b> In the film and video production industry, 3D scanning is used to create detailed 3D models of sets, characters, and props. This technology allows filmmakers to enhance the visual effects and realism of their productions.</li>
											</ul>
												<p>
													Design
Started the project with the traditional sketching tools like CAD to create rough concepts of the spider bot. The main considerations during this phase were to design the leg of the bot in such a way that the leg could move in multiple degrees of freedom to mimic the movement of a real spier. And at the same time also need a lightweight yet a strong frame to hold the electronics and servos. The 3d modelling software allowed me to sculpt using different drawing tools, shape manipulation and parametric modelling to bring my ideas to life. With these tools, I was able to design a leg to meet the exact specifications required for the bots functionality.

Simulation and Testing
Once the initial design was complete, simulations were done to test the robot’s movement. 
1.	Stability check - I had to ensure that the spider bot could maintain balance while walking. The main objective in the initial stage was the placement of the robot leg as it plays a critical role in maintaining the balance of the robot. The robot requires to tilt its torso from left to right, simultaneously the robot should move forward and backward. 
2.	Range of motion – Had to make sure the legs had sufficient range of motion so that they don’t interfere with each other. 
Testing and Iteration
3D modelling software often includes animation tool that allows me to test and simulate the movement of spider bots in virtual world. This is particularly useful for testing and refining the bot’s locomotion. The simulation phase revealed several critical insights:
•	The initial leg design lacked sufficient range of motion, leading to awkward and unstable movement.
•	The body structure required reinforcement in certain areas to prevent flexing under load.
•	The placement of the power supply needed adjustment to achieve better balance.
These findings led to several iterations in the design, refining the leg joints, reinforcing the body frame, and repositioning components.

											<h3>Transition to Physical Prototyping</h3>
											<ul class="alt">
												<li>1.	<b>Haptic Input Hardware</b> these devices provide physical feedback to the user allowing them to feel the virtual objects while they are created, to make it easier to manipulate objects and shapes with precision. For example, haptic devices such as stylus based systems or gloves can stimulate the sensation of sculpting or objects in real life. </li>
												<li>2.	<b>3D printing hardware</b> with this printing hardware physical prototypes of your 3D models can be printed with ease. This allows the user to test the design and functionality of the models. This was the most used hardware for this project. As multiple times, I had to print 3D models of my spider bots leg to make adjustments or improvements to my 3D model. Polylactic Acid is one of the materials we used in 3d printing.</li>
												<li>3.	<b>Laser cutting hardware</b> laser cutting allows the user to create physical prototypes of 3D models quickly with a higher precision allowing to create intricate designs with fine details. The main benefit of laser cutting is allows us to 3D print physical prototypes which may need multiple testing. Laser cutting also enables the user to etch or engrave text logos rather designs on the surface of the material. Laser cutting works best with certain materials like metals unlike PLA which I used in my project. It can sometimes result in material warping or burning. Also do too it's cost we did not resort to this method.</li>
												<li>4. <b>Resin Production and Postproduction</b> Resin is a common material used in 3D printing. It provides the user with highest strength, flexibility or heat resistance depending on the needs of the printed parts. Post production facilities includes crucial steps such as washing to remove excess resin, curing to fully harden the printed parts and additional processes such as sanding polishing or painting the desired surface quality. Materials offer the user unique advantage such as high strength to weight ratio. Integrating other materials along with resin Results in lightweight yet robust structure for your spider model. Polylactic acid, also known as PLA is the material i used in my 3D printing</li>

									<h3>Left &amp; Right</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/leg.jpg" alt="" /></span>1.	The primary objective was to design four legs for the robot. Gather images of the  The legs of the robot from different angle. This helped me understand the anatomy. The bot legs must be printed in x,y,z coordinates. Therefore making four leg joints that is capable of agile movement. This can be done by rendering it in blender. </p>
