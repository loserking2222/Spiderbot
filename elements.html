									<h2>                                  BY Aron Michael Delson</h2>
									
									<header>
										<h2>Introduction</h2>
										<p>In the realm of robotics, innovation often takes inspiration from nature's most ingenious designs. One such marvel is the full legged spider robot. Humans cannot travel to every point on the surface, yet they still require information from such locations. As a result, researchers carefully analysed and have designed a cutting-edge technology a biomimetic robot. This portfolio documents my experience in designing and developing a prototype for a four-legged spider. Throughout this module, I have explored various techniques and technologies to create a virtual prototype, which was then translated into a physical prototype.</p>

					
										<h2>Product Development Strategy: A Chronological Narrative</h2>
											
										<h2>Phase 1: Conceptualization (Weeks 1-4)</h2>
										<p>In the initial phase, our team brainstormed ideas for a conversational AI bot that could be of use the society, something that is also compatible with the university guidelines but at the same time should also look cool enough. We conducted research, put out different idea out there and identified key features that our bot should possess. We then decided to focus on building a four legged spider bot.</p>

										<h2> Successes: </h2>
										<ul>
												<li>	Identified key features and functionalities for the bot </li>
												<li>	Established a clear direction for the project </li>
										</ul>			



							<h2> Challenges: </h2>
										<ul>
												<li>	•	Difficulty in defining the scope of the project</li>
												<li>	•	Limited understanding of the technical requirements </li>
										</ul>	

							<h2>Purpose </h2>
										<p> A biomimetic robot can explore earth's environment in dangerous and difficult places. By carefully studying the anatomy of  a spider, researchers aim was to replicate or mimic the moments of a spider that gives the same range of motion similar to spiders natural movement. This inspired the 3° of freedom fabrication for each leg which minimises the robots weight and complexity. The chosen structure gives the robot manoeuvrability on uneven surface including examining precarious structures like earthquakes, tsunami's or volcanic eruptions. </p>

							
							

								
									<h2>Phase 2: Virtual Prototyping and Stimulation (Weeks 5-8)</h2>
									<p> Initially I had to create the virtual robotic exoskeletons. Virtual prototyping is crucial in spider bot making as it enables early software development, reducing the total time necessary to develop and test new products.  This makes it cost effective and allows me to carry out a hypothesis-driven virtual experiments on my robot. In this report, we will also talk about the significance of virtual prototyping, the tools used, the challenges faced and the transitioning to physical prototyping. With a clear understanding of the project's scope, the next step was designing the spider bot. </p>

											<h3>Computer-Aided Design (CAD)</h3>
											<p>CAD software such as SolidWorks, Autodesk Inventor allows engineers to create detailed 3D models of spider bot and optimize the performance of the robots before they are built. Using such software allows the user to simulate the movement of the bot based on the roles depicted by the bot(1). </p>
											
											
											<ul>
												<li>	<b>Autonomous Vehicles and Drones</b>:AGVs and drones are other examples where CAD plays an important role. These are boats that are used in sectors where the object is always moving. CAD helps the engineer to work on the frame of the vehicle or drone virtually to test ground movements and how will it function in air. It also provides the user with different simulations such as terrains and other obstacles in which the user can navigate the vehicle and make sure they are more effective in real world applications.(2)</li>
												<li>	<b>	Humanoid Robots</b> 
                                                                                           Robots that resemble humans, like Honda's ASIMA, are examples of the most cutting-edge robotics applications. These are robots whose joints and exoskeletons are modelled using advanced computer-aided design (CAD) technologies. Next, in order to evaluate the robot's agility, the developers build simulated surroundings where it may walk, run, and climb.(3) </li>												
											<h3>3D Modelling Software</h3>
												<p>
												3D modelling software plays a vital role in the design and development process, enabling designers and engineers to create a digital prototype of the robot, test its functionality, and refine its design before physical prototyping. The software allows me to customise and personalise 3D models down to the smallest detail ensuring the object matches the design accurately. It enables the creation of complex geometries that may be difficult or impossible to achieve using traditional manufacturing methods. It also allowed me to make quick changes before printing the final version.
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>	<b>•	Aerospace Engineering</b>In the aerospace industry 3D morning software plays a vital role in the development of complex digital models off spacecraft, aircraft and missiles. Does enables engineers to optimise the design of their craft by reducing weight and improving performance when stimulating the behaviour of these vehicles under heavy turbulence and extreme temperatures. They are able to refine the design before producing a physical prototype. </li>
												<li>	<b>•	Medical Device Development</b> In the medical device industry, 3D modelling software plays a critical role in the design and development of medical implants, surgical instruments, and diagnostic equipment. The software enables designers to create complex digital models of these devices, test their performance, and refine their design before physical prototyping. 3D modelling software enables designers to optimize the design of medical devices, reducing material costs and improving performance of these devices under various conditions, such as stress and fatigue.(4)</li>
											</ul>
											<h3>Motion Capture Hardware</h3>
																							<p>Motion capture is the process of capturing moments of a sculpture or artist, this moment can then be translated into digital form for precise digital sculpting. This digital model can then be printed into a 3D model to create a physical representation of the original sculpture. This could play a vital role in the development of my spider bot by enabling the precise recording of movement patterns, which can then be replicated or analysed to enhance the bot’s locomotion. I was unable to duplicate anything because I lacked a pre-made model of a spider bot, thus I refrained from using it during the design development process. Other industries benefit from motion capture are:</p>


											<ul>
												<li>	<b>3D 	Sports and Fitness</b> Motion capture technology is utilised in the sports and fitness industries to enhance athletic performance. It accomplishes this by giving the user tiny reflective markers to place on common athlete vital locations, such as the knees, shoulders, hips, and joints. These are important starting points for a significant shift that must be documented. The athlete is then captured on camera by a motion capture device while they execute a sequence of actions like running, jumping, and throwing.(5) Their instructors or trainers then examine the captured data to gain important insights about their motions and shortcomings.</li>
												<li>	<b>3D Video Games and Animation</b> Motion capture technology is used in the video game and animation industries to record people's movements, allowing animators to generate realistic character movements. Wearing a capture suit or a suit with reflective marker points that pre-mark the essential joint movements, an actor executes a series of actions. A motion capture technology is then used to record the actors' motions and gather real-time data. After being converted into a digital format, the captured data is applied to a 3D character model. This 3D character model shows the actor's actions as they would appear in an animated film or video game.(6) </li>
											</ul>
												<h3>3D Scanning Hardware, Software, and Workshop Facilities</h3>
												<p>it's a high precision 3D scanner or laser scanner which captures physical objects and convert them into digital models.  The hardware typically involves laser or structured light scanners, which create detailed 3D models by capturing millions of data points from the surface of an object. High-resolution 3D scanners like the Artec Eva or the Faro Arm can capture fine details of prototype parts, ensuring accuracy in the digital twin. I didn’t use this software in the building of my spider bot as it was not required. But various other industries that use 3d scanning are</p>

												
											<ul>
												<li>	<b>•	3D scanning in healthcare</b> The hospital uses a 3D scanner to scan the patient's body's physical components, including the size and form of their bones and organs. A software is used to process the discount data and produce a three-dimensional model of the scanned area. They can provide treatments by testing it on a 3d model. Also by offering precise scans of the bodily part that has been amputated and attaching the 3D model to it, they are also utilised in the creation of prosthesis or implants.</li>
												<li>	<b>•	3D Scanning in Film and Video Production</b> In the film and video production industry, 3D scanning is used to create detailed 3D models of sets, characters, and props. This technology allows filmmakers to enhance the visual effects and realism of their productions.(7)</li>
											</ul>
												<p>
													<h3>Design</h3>
Started the project with the traditional sketching tools like CAD to create rough concepts of the spider bot. The main considerations during this phase were to design the leg of the bot in such a way that the leg could move in multiple degrees of freedom to mimic the movement of a real spier. And at the same time also need a lightweight yet a strong frame to hold the electronics and servos. The 3d modelling software allowed me to sculpt using different drawing tools, shape manipulation and parametric modelling to bring my ideas to life. With these tools, I was able to design a leg to meet the exact specifications required for the bots functionality.

<h3>Simulation and Testing</h3>
													
Once the initial design was complete, simulations were done to test the robot’s movement. 
<ul>													
<li>.	Stability check - I had to ensure that the spider bot could maintain balance while walking. The main objective in the initial stage was the placement of the robot leg as it plays a critical role in maintaining the balance of the robot. The robot requires to tilt its torso from left to right, simultaneously the robot should move forward and backward. </li>
<li>.	Range of motion – Had to make sure the legs had sufficient range of motion so that they don’t interfere with each other. </li>
</ul>
	<h3>Testing and Iteration</h3>
3D modelling software often includes animation tool that allows me to test and simulate the movement of spider bots in virtual world. This is particularly useful for testing and refining the bot’s locomotion. The simulation phase revealed several critical insights:
<ul>
											<li>	•	The initial leg design lacked sufficient range of motion, leading to awkward and unstable movement. </li>
<li>•	The body structure required reinforcement in certain areas to prevent flexing under load.</li>
<li>•	The placement of the power supply needed adjustment to achieve better balance. </li>
	</ul>
These findings led to several iterations in the design, refining the leg joints, reinforcing the body frame, and repositioning components.

												</p>

											<h3>Transition to Physical Prototyping</h3>
												<p>The exoskeleton of the robot play some pivotal role in the development of 4 legged spider bot. This serves structural framework which offer a lightweight yet robust outer shell that enables agile movement and resilience to external forces. The next goal off was to 3d print a spider bot that operates well in challenging environments and uneven terrain. </p>
											<h3>3D printing hardware </h3>
								<p>3D printing is a key technology in the prototyping of a four-legged spider bot, allowing for the rapid and cost-effective production of complex parts. It refers to the physical components and machines used in the 3D printing process, also known as additive manufacturing. This includes 3D printers, printing materials, and other equipment necessary for creating three-dimensional objects layer by layer</p>	
												<ul class="alt">
												<li>	<b>	Automotive Industry </b> In the automobile industry 3D printing hardware has enabled the rapid production of car parts such as dashboard, interior components and some certain parts of the engine's. They provide the 3D printer with the model which needs to be repeated by this way the production time goes up to 90%. This was used by Volkswagen to 3D print their customised car parts. </li>
												<li>	<b>	Architecture and Construction Industry </b> Some architecture and construction industry has enabled 3D printing for the rapid production of building components such as walls roof and bridges. The company feeds a 3D printer with customised designs and complex structures which is then repeated by 3D printing layer by layer which reduces construction time and cost(8)</li>
											</ul>

								<h3>Haptic Input Hardware</h3>
								<p>Haptic input hardware, combined with 3D sculpting software, offers a tactile and intuitive way to design and refine components for a four-legged spider bot.Phantom provide force feedback, allowing designers to feel the virtual objects they are manipulating. This haptic feedback is crucial for detailed sculpting, as it gives a physical sense of the shapes, textures, and resistance of materials being worked on.</p>		
								<ul>
							<li>	<b>	Education and Traininge</b>  </li>
							<li>	<b>	Gaming and Entertainment Industry </b>  </li>

								</ul>	
								
								<h3>Transition to Physical Prototyping</h3>
								<p></p>		
								<ul>
							<li>	<b>Haptic Input Hardware</b>  Using the haptic input hardware, allows us to provide the students and professional with immersive and interactive simulations. This provides hands on training for the students improve their skills and confidence to lead better patient outcomes. This is also used in flight training by simulating flight experiences and enhancing the training and reducing risk of accidents.</li>
							<li>	<b>Haptic Input Hardware</b> In the gaming industry's now virtual environment toys and recoil of guns and explosions can be felt by the player. This increases player engagement and enjoyment. For example play station 5 dual sense controller feature has haptic feedback allowing players to feel it in real time. </li>

								</ul>	
								
								<h3>Laser Cutting Hardware</h3>
								<p>Laser cutting hardware refers to machines that use high-powered lasers to precision-cut and engrave materials such as metals, woods, plastics, and fabrics. It is an essential tool for fabricating flat components and enclosures for a four-legged spider bot. These machines use computer-aided design (CAD) files to guide the laser beam, allowing for intricate designs and precise cuts.</p>		
								<ul>
							<li>	<b>	Fashion and Textile Industry</b> In fashion and textile industry, laser cutting hardware as enabled creations of new designs and publications on Leathers and other materials. This has allowed fashion designers to create customised designs with high precision accuracy. (9)</li>
							<li>	<b>	Aerospace and defence </b> In the aerospace and defence industry laser cutting hardware as enabled precision cutting of hardware part such as aircraft, satellite components. These materials need high precision cutting yet strong components that meets the standards of the industry. (10)</li>
