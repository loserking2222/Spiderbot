										<h2>Introduction</h2>
										<p>In the realm of robotics, innovation often takes inspiration from nature's most ingenious designs. One such marvel is the full legged spider robot. Humans cannot travel to every point on the surface, yet they still require information from such locations. As a result, researchers carefully analysed and have designed a cutting-edge technology a biomimetic robot. This portfolio documents my experience in designing and developing a prototype for a four-legged spider. Throughout this module, I have explored various techniques and technologies to create a virtual prototype, which was then translated into a physical prototype.</p>

					
										<h2>Product Development Strategy: A Chronological Narrative<h2>
											
										</h2>Phase 1: Conceptualization (Weeks 1-4)</h2>
										<p>In the initial phase, our team brainstormed ideas for a conversational AI bot that could be of use the society, something that is also compatible with the university guidelines but at the same time should also look cool enough. We conducted research, put out different idea out there and identified key features that our bot should possess. We then decided to focus on building a four legged spider bot.</p>

									<h2>Virtual prototyping and the transitioning to physical prototyping</h2>
									<p>Virtual prototyping is becoming a cornerstone in modern product development. This enables the user to use computer aided engineering software to validate a design before committing to a physical component. This makes it cost effective and accelerates the development cycle. In this report, we will talk about the significance of virtual prototyping, the tools used, the challenges faced and the transitioning to physical prototyping.</p>

											<h3>Virtual prototyping Tools</h3>
											<ul>
												<li>1.	<b>CAD software</b>: CAD software allows designers to create complex 3D models from scratch. Models can be manipulated by using various tools and features in cab. The software allows me to customise and personalise 3D models down to the smallest detail ensuring the object matches the design accurately. It enables the creation of complex geometries that may be difficult or impossible to achieve using traditional manufacturing methods. It also allowed me to make quick changes before printing the final version. Example Autodesk. Allowed me to make accurate designs on my botâ€™s leg.</li>
												<li>2.	<b>3D modelling software</b> 3D modelling software plays a crucial role in printing 3D objects that enables users to create or modify digital models of it. The software allowed me to sculpt Using different drawing tools, shape manipulation and parametric modelling to bring my ideas to life. It has efficient 3D modelling features that allows automatic support generation, To ensure successful printing of over hanging parts of the design Are mesh repair tools that fix any errors in the geometry of the model. Before printing an object, it gives me the 3D visualisation off the model before printing it. This feature allowed me to see any potential flaw in my model.</li>
												<li>3.	<b>3D scanning hardware and software</b> it's a high precision 3D scanner or laser scanner which captures physical objects and convert them into digital models. This offer was not used by me as I had to make the model from scratch using CAD software. This software helps in creating accurate replicas or modification of existing objects. It allows the users to capture unique shapes and sizes which can then be further modified before 3D printing. Well the traditional methods of creating 3D models involved measuring and modelling, 3D scan help save the time and effort off the user.</li>
												<li>4.	<b>Motion Capture</b> Motion capture is the process of capturing moments of a sculpture or artist, this moment can then be translated into digital form for precise digital sculpting. This digital model can then be printed into a 3D model to create a physical representation of the original sculpture. I have not used motion capture in my project as I do not require to capture any realistic characters.</li>
											</ul>

											<h3>Transition to Physical Prototyping</h3>
											<ul class="alt">
												<li>1.	<b>Haptic Input Hardware</b> these devices provide physical feedback to the user allowing them to feel the virtual objects while they are created, to make it easier to manipulate objects and shapes with precision. For example, haptic devices such as stylus based systems or gloves can stimulate the sensation of sculpting or objects in real life. </li>
												<li>2.	<b>3D printing hardware</b> with this printing hardware physical prototypes of your 3D models can be printed with ease. This allows the user to test the design and functionality of the models. This was the most used hardware for this project. As multiple times, I had to print 3D models of my spider bots leg to make adjustments or improvements to my 3D model. Polylactic Acid is one of the materials we used in 3d printing.</li>
												<li>3.	<b>Laser cutting hardware</b> laser cutting allows the user to create physical prototypes of 3D models quickly with a higher precision allowing to create intricate designs with fine details. The main benefit of laser cutting is allows us to 3D print physical prototypes which may need multiple testing. Laser cutting also enables the user to etch or engrave text logos rather designs on the surface of the material. Laser cutting works best with certain materials like metals unlike PLA which I used in my project. It can sometimes result in material warping or burning. Also do too it's cost we did not resort to this method.</li>
												<li>4. <b>Resin Production and Postproduction</b> Resin is a common material used in 3D printing. It provides the user with highest strength, flexibility or heat resistance depending on the needs of the printed parts. Post production facilities includes crucial steps such as washing to remove excess resin, curing to fully harden the printed parts and additional processes such as sanding polishing or painting the desired surface quality. Materials offer the user unique advantage such as high strength to weight ratio. Integrating other materials along with resin Results in lightweight yet robust structure for your spider model. Polylactic acid, also known as PLA is the material i used in my 3D printing</li>

									<h3>Left &amp; Right</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/leg.jpg" alt="" /></span>1.	The primary objective was to design four legs for the robot. Gather images of the  The legs of the robot from different angle. This helped me understand the anatomy. The bot legs must be printed in x,y,z coordinates. Therefore making four leg joints that is capable of agile movement. This can be done by rendering it in blender. </p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/femur.jpg" alt="" /></span>Then a bracket with two open ends are printed. To which the leg containing the servo motor is connected to. 
										Then take another bracket to which a servo motor is connected.
										Take the 3d printed body to which 4 servo motor should be connected.
